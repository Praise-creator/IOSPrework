Canvas AutoScheduler 

The Canvas AutoScheduler is a companion app designed to automatically organize and schedule all of a student’s assignments, quizzes, exams, and project deadlines directly from their Canvas courses, without the tedious manual entry that most calendar apps require. The app syncs with the student’s Canvas account, pulls due dates, and intelligently creates a personalized study schedule that balances workload across days and weeks.
